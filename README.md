## QuickStart

If you wanna use data augmentation method only, see util.py in the acoustic scene classification or sound event classification and use Generator classes.  
Since the Generator classes are written by numpy, you can use it to both Pytorch and Tensorflow.  
Reference of Generator class: https://github.com/yu4u/mixup-generator
